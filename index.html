<h2>What is a Cloud Mining Polatform?</h2>
<p>A cloud mining polatform enables users to rent computing power from data centers that operate mining hardware. Instead of buying your own mining rig, you purchase contracts or hash power, allowing you to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or others without technical setups or maintenance. The platform manages all the equipment, and you earn rewards proportional to your rented mining power.</p>
